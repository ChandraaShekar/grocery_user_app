including through user surveys. In some locations, we may also receive
demographic data about users from third parties.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white;border:none'><span
lang=EN-IN style='font-size:12.0pt;color:#222222'>III

for other users, restaurants or merchants, or otherwise contact Frutee. This

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white;border:none'><span
lang=EN-IN style='font-size:12.0pt;color:#222222'>5.<b><u>Travel
information</u></b>: We collect travel itinerary information, including the
times and dates of upcoming orders, from users of our Frutte Travel feature.<br>
We collect such information:<br>
(A) When users manually input their information in the app<br>
(B) If authorized by users to access their Gmail accounts, from travel-related
email confirmations. If so authorized, Frutte will only access users’ Gmail
accounts to collect tracking information to enable the Frutte Travel feature,
and will adhere to Google’s API Services User Data Policy, including the
limitations on use of data collected from users’ Gmail accounts.<br>
(C) Data created during use of our services.<br>
This includes:<br>
I) Location data (Delivery recipients): We collect delivery recipients data on
precise or approximate location data to enable and enhance use of our apps,
including to improve pick-ups, facilitate deliveries, enable safety features,
and prevent and detect fraud.<br>
We collect such data from user’s mobile devices if they enable us to do so.<br>
&nbsp;“Choice and transparency” is briefly described on how riders and delivery
recipients can enable location data collection. Frutte collects such data from
the time a ride or delivery is requested until it is finished (and may indicate
such collection via an icon or notification on your mobile device depending on
your device’s operating system), and any time the app is running in the
foreground (app open and on-screen) of their mobile device.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white;border:none'><span
lang=EN-IN style='font-size:12.0pt;color:#222222'>Riders
and delivery recipients may use the Frutte apps without enabling Frutte to
collect precise location data from their mobile devices. However, this may
affect features in the Frutte app.<br>
For example, a user who has not enabled location data collection will have to
manually enter their pick-up address. In addition, the location data collected
from a driver during a trip will be linked to the rider’s account, even if the
rider has not enabled location data to be collected from their device,
including for purposes of receipt generation, customer support, fraud
detection, insurance, and litigation.</span></p>

services, including the type of services requested or provided, order details,
payment transaction information (such as a restaurant’s or merchant's name and
location and amount of transaction), delivery information, date and time the
service was provided, amount charged, distance traveled, and payment method.
Additionally, if someone uses your promotion code, we may associate your name
with that person.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:white;border:none'><span
lang=EN-IN style='font-size:12.0pt;color:#222222'>III)Communications
data: We enable users to communicate with each other and Frutee through Frutte
mobile apps and websites. For example, we enable drivers and riders, and
delivery persons and delivery recipients, to call, text, or send other files to
each other (generally without disclosing their telephone numbers to each
other).<br>
To provide this service, Frutte receives some data regarding the calls, texts,
or other communications, including the date and time of the communications and
the content of the communications. Uber may also use this data for customer
support services (including to resolve disputes between users), for safety and
